# Introduction:

This is the Final Year Project for Bachelor Degree in Software Engineering, In this Project  we are using the Internet of things to create a Smart Parking Assistance System, In this system we are using IR Sensors, Arduino UNO Board and connect that Arduino Board with a website and Android Application. The purpose of this application to provide help to user to park their cars save time along the way.
